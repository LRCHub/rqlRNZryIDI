How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up
(You are watching a master at work)
(Quiet on set, quiet on set)
(I'm using my imagination)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I blew out my chakras, I ain't need no doctor
I be sippin' straight black, whippin' out the Honda
I be spittin' this shit too fast, I can't keep a saunter
I'm gon' give away excess cash, greed will fucking' haunt you, yeah (uh)
A bad bitch with the messy hair
Yeah, I've been on my own shit and I never cared
So done with the good for nothin'
The "Why so self-assured? You're bluffing"
It's all personal
If I fuck with your shit, you better take it personal
I'm murderin' any beat you send me 'cause I'm versatile
But if I ain't like your shit, then you won't get a verse at all
I came to vibe, but he just wanted to dap me up
And I don't fuck around
Boy, I'm leavin' that beat deceased, put it underground
Puttin' in elbow grease, takin' back the crown
I'm just makin' a masterpiece from my daddy's house (chorus)
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess (don't stop)
Hit me double bound, I still be the one
This shit goin' south, I still see the sun
In it, here and now, I ain't gonna run
To a savior or a harbor or a haven
Dope shit's never on purpose
Tryna keep it controlled is so worthless
Still in my prime but it's like I ain't been before
'Cause I'm never on time, gotta let that shit find me
Give me a moment
I'm dizzy off the sound 'cause I mix it potent
So then I break it down into its components
You do it for the crowd? That's a bad omen, oh (ooh)
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
Do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
Dope as fuck, I guess I'm-
Hands start to shake and I'm thinkin' rapidly
Bitch, I'm seein' the truth in my circle, just like it's alchemy
Don't get in the booth 'til the beats are defyin' gravity
Ears been fuckin' blessed with a curse to be the best on the Earth
It's non-duality the way I lose myself in the method
And the strategy is solid, I'ma beat it to death
I'm like a machine, I'm diggin' out dopamine
You're never gonna find it, keepin' it quiet
Stay up all night and make the hardest shit you've ever seen
I don't fold under pressure
Yeah, whether manic, love or depression
Every body-mind shift, I'm growin' the vessel
Half you motherfuckers feedin' off my essence
Yeah, brew too cold, they need a refresher
Yeah, I'm gon' wield this art like a weapon
'Cause I'ma seein' past the bullshit
Pit me on the pulpit, pick it out, it's only my perception
Now I decide
So use this shit as guide when makin' that fuckin' type beat
And good luck findin' anyone like me
I got the whole scene weighin' on my psyche
'Cause I'm desperate for progression
We get closer to perfection, every session
When we linkin'? Uh
Pain poised when I make noise, cap get diminished
I'ma too advanced for the game, boy, I'ma need a minute
(Truth)
